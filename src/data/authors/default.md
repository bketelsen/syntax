I'm a cloud developer advocate at Microsoft Azure. I love learning and experimenting
and you'll always find me trying to connect things that weren't previously connected
or build things that haven't been built.

Along with Erik St. Martin, I co-founded GopherCon, the largest Go conference in the
world.

While my strengths lie in the backend, I've been forcing myself to learn frontend
development recently, and enjoy Next.js and Svelte quite a bit.
